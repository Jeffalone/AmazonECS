# Amazon ECS
This repo is to demonstrate my proficiency in the Amazon suit. 
In this project I create a simple node/express container and push it to an ECR registry. The terraform code provisions the ECS cluster, security groups, load balancer, etc. to make it publicaly accessable. 

Here is the link to the live cluster: http://test-lb-tf-1046334449.us-east-2.elb.amazonaws.com
